# cpnt260-final-project

For this final project, I made a redesigned Nike website and changed the style that the Nike website went for in a way. 

## Instructions

First page is the page that you first load into which is the home page.
The next page is the products page and you get there by clicking on the products link in the header.
The one after that is the services page and the link for that one is in the header as well.
